## Requirements

1. **Data Loading**: Load in an initial set
of todos from this sample json server
https://github.com/typicode/json-server

2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination in
the front end to read 5 todos at a time from
the mock json server, with paging to get the
next 5, or previous 5
https://github.com/typicode/json-server?tab=readme-ov-file#paginate

3. **CRUD Operations**: Allow users to perform
CRUD on the Todos; I.e edit the todos grabbed
from the json server, delete them, and create
new ones ( do not need to write to the json server)

4. **No Backend Persistence**: Changes should not
be saved to the server

### Optional

5. **UI Components**: Use some component library for
clean interface
